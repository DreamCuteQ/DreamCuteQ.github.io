# 我的第一个Blog
# My First Blog

- 唔，用了好久终于搭建好了我自己的Blog了，今天是2019年9月29日，准确来说在28号我就开始着手做前期准备了。
- Emm,it took me a long time and I have already built up my own Blog.Today is September 29th，year2019,actually,at 28th,I was begining to prepare for this.



- 今天搭建这个真的是好不容易，按照网上的教程折腾了半天。最开始在github上的项目选的是私人的（应该选成公开的），然后发现怎么都链接不了，真的被自己蠢哭了。然后查了好多的资料，才解决了这个问题。唔，我把资料附在上面吧，感觉还是比较实用的。就是这个[链接](https://www.cnblogs.com/blogjun/articles/8289977.html)
- It was quite difficult for me today,I tried to solve the problem with a long time and find many information.At the beginning,I chose the private for my project(it should be public),then I find that it cannot link to my Blog,how silly I am.Emm,I will give you a website,I think this is quite helpful.

- 我就先尝试发一个Blog吧，我把我的Blog地址也附在这里啦，虽然你们能看见这个的时候已经知道地址了，嘿嘿嘿。[DreamCuteQ](http://DreamCuteQ.github.io) 对了，我现在先用人家的域名写上一段时间，等过一阵了，我可以去买上一个属于自己的域名，欧耶。
- I try to write one Blog on here,I will give you an address of my Blog,although you are knowing it if you see this Blog,hhh.[DreamCuteQ](http://DreamCuteQ.github.io)By the way,the domain name I use does not belong to me,I plan to use it for serval time.After a while,I can buy a domain name which really belongs to me,oh yeah.

- 因为技术原因，本该昨天发上去的Blog一直拖到了今天，我可能还是太菜了。
- Because of technical matter,I did not upload the Blog until to now,may be ,I need to be stonger.

- 另外，还是要非常感谢李总和谢总的，昨天那么晚了还能陪我在外面喝酒。昨天不知道咋了，就是突然想喝酒，也许有那么一点忧郁吧。
- By the way,I give pretty thankful to Mr.Li and Ms.Xie,thank for them company and drinking with me for a long time.I did not know what happened yestarday.I just wanted to have a dringking,I may be quite melancholy.
